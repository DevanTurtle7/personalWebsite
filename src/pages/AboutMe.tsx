        <p>
          Hi, my name is Devan Kavalchek, I'm a passionate and detail oriented
          software engineer. I'm a third year student at the Rochester Institute
          of Technology pursuing a B.S. in Software Engineering. Recently, I've
          been enjoying working with ReactJS, SQL, Java, and learning TensorFlow
          using Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm extremely passionate about software and love expressing my
          creativity through it. I always strive to have an in-depth
          understanding of whatever language or framework I'm working with so
          that I can better optimize and style my code. I'm a fast learner and
          always looking for a new technology to learn.
        </p>
